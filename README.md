## Project Title

Community Voting Platform with NFT Auctions

## Project Description

The Community Voting Platform with NFT Auctions is a decentralized platform where users can buy, sell, and auction digital art pieces in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Art pieces can be listed for sale at a fixed price or auctioned to the highest bidder. The platform uses a smart contract to handle the transactions, ensuring that the art pieces are securely bought, sold, and transferred on the blockchain.

This platform combines community-driven art appreciation with tokenized ownership, enabling artists to monetize their work through NFTs while giving buyers the ability to own unique digital assets. Auctions provide an exciting and transparent way for collectors to compete for high-value pieces.

## Project Vision

The vision for the Community Voting Platform is to provide a decentralized marketplace for artists and collectors to interact, enabling transparent, secure, and efficient art sales. The platform aims to empower artists by allowing them to directly sell and auction their work, while ensuring buyers can confidently invest in digital art with a guarantee of ownership and authenticity. This project seeks to bridge the gap between the art community and blockchain technology, creating a vibrant, decentralized ecosystem for digital art.

## Future Scope
